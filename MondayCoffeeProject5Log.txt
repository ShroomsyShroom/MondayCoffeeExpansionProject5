--Monday Coffee Project--

1. Firstly create a database in PostgreSQL.
2. After creating the data base create table for the datasets you've available. i.e City, Products, Customers, and Sales.
Code:
A. For creating city table:

CREATE TABLE city
	(
		city_id	INT PRIMARY KEY,
		city_name VARCHAR(15),	
		population BIGINT,
		estimated_rent FLOAT,
		city_rank INT
	);

B. For creating customers table:

CREATE TABLE customers
	(
		customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
		customer_name VARCHAR(25),
		city_id INT,
		CONSTRAINT fk_city FOREIGN KEY(city_id) REFERENCES city(city_id)
	);

C. For creating products table:

CREATE TABLE products
	(
		product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
		product_name VARCHAR(35),	
		price FLOAT
	);

D. For creating sales table:

CREATE TABLE sales
	(
		sale_id	INT PRIMARY KEY,
		sale_date DATE,
		product_id INT,
		customer_id	INT,
		total FLOAT,
		rating INT,
		CONSTRAINT fk_products FOREIGN KEY(product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id),
		CONSTRAINT fk_customers FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
	);

With this all of your schemas are created.

3. Now that we've created the schemas lets populate them with data.
Now, while importing data keep the foreign key relations in mind.
Hence, import the data in following order:

A. Import data to cities table first.
B. Then import to the products table.
C. Then import the customers table.
D. Now, finally import to the sales table.

With that all the data is imported. We can move forward with generating the ERD for the databse to assist in analysis.

4. After generating the ERD(entity-relationship diagram) we can move fwd w the actual EDA.

Q1. Coffee Consumers Count
How many people in each city are estimated to consume coffee, given that 25% of the population does?
